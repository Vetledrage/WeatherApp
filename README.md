# Weather PawCast: 
## Case 3. Weather Forecast and Danger Warnings for Younger Users

#### Weather PawCast is a weather app made to inform a younger audience about weather and danger alerts. Using child friendly designs and fun features we hope to attract users in the age range 9 to 25.

#### Key features in the app are API calls getting the newest weather info and dageralerts and presenting it. Getting the location of user, but also making it possible for user to choose a specific location.

# Installations
#### You can download the App via this GitHub project page or via devilry at UIO.

# Running the App
#### We have used Android Studio Iguana to implement and run the App. When dowloading the code, make sure it is ran using this program. 
#### https://developer.android.com/studio/releases
#### No other installations should be neccesary. Make sure gradle sync is up to date. 

# Usage 
#### If the code is downloaded and gradle is synced, you can run the App in Android Studio. Make sure that you are connected to Wi-Fi. 
#### If you run the code and change internett after, running again could make the API calls fail. Therefore terminating the App then running it again on the new internett (Not rerun, but cancel then run),will fix this problem.

# Libraries used
#### Most of the code is very basic code implemeted using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. We are also using kotlinx for the livedata features. Java and kotlin utils is also great libraries that give us access useful fucntions.
